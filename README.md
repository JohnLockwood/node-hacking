# Just Some Node Hacking

... to learn me some node for a great good

* jest_testing hasn't worked out well yet.  Module fun at the heart of it mostly
* mocha_testing went quite well and was very node-friendly.  This uses commonjs require 
for imports.
* mjs_mocha_testing - Trying to see if we can use [ECMA style imports](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#packages_determining_module_system)
* mjs2_mocha_testing - A second attempt at ECMA style imports.  This time setting type in package.json.
This is the simpler case.
